# Crowd Liquidity Overview  

## Introduction  

Crowd Liquidity is a system that enables stablecoin holders to passively contribute liquidity to the Eco network and earn yield in return. By pooling user balances, Crowd Liquidity ensures that stablecoin liquidity is readily available where and when it’s needed, reducing transaction costs and improving execution efficiency for cross-chain transactions.  

Unlike traditional liquidity models, which rely on professional market makers, Crowd Liquidity allows **any user** to participate—democratizing access to yield while keeping funds liquid and accessible.  

## How It Works  

Crowd Liquidity functions as a **shared liquidity pool** that services stablecoin transactions across the Eco network. Users who hold stablecoins in an Eco Account or a connected application can opt in to Crowd Liquidity, making their balances available for transaction fulfillment.  

- **Liquidity is pooled** from participating users across multiple stablecoins and chains.  
- **Solvers (market makers, arbitrageurs, AI agents)** borrow from this pool to facilitate cross-chain transactions.  
- **Users earn passive yield** on their contributed funds, in addition to any native stablecoin yield.  
- **Funds remain liquid and spendable**, allowing users to withdraw or transact at any time.  

By aggregating stablecoin liquidity in a decentralized manner, Crowd Liquidity improves execution speed, lowers costs, and enhances network resilience.  

## Benefits of Crowd Liquidity  

### For Stablecoin Holders  
- **Earn passive income** by contributing to liquidity without active management.  
- **Keep funds accessible**—balances remain liquid and available for transactions.  
- **Maximize yield** by earning on top of native stablecoin rewards.  

### For the Eco Network  
- **Ensures liquidity availability** to support fast and efficient stablecoin transactions.  
- **Reduces reliance on centralized market makers** by distributing liquidity provision across users.  
- **Optimizes capital allocation** to meet transaction demand dynamically.  

## Use Cases  

Crowd Liquidity powers various transaction types across the Eco network, including:  
- **Cross-chain stablecoin transfers** – Liquidity is allocated dynamically to fulfill transactions.  
- **Bridging and swaps** – Users can move funds across chains with minimal friction.  
- **Yield optimization** – Passive balances generate income while remaining available for use.  

## Roadmap  

Crowd Liquidity will launch in phases, with the following key milestones:  

- **Q1 2025:** Beta launch, allowing early users to contribute liquidity and earn rewards.  
- **Q2 2025:** Full integration with Eco Accounts and Routes, enabling seamless cross-chain stable sends.  
- **Summer 2025:** Launch of the ECO token, introducing governance and staking mechanisms for liquidity providers.  

## Getting Started  

Crowd Liquidity will be available to all Eco Account holders and integrated applications. More details on participation, rewards, and governance will be provided closer to launch.
