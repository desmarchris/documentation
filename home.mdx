Eco enables any onchain action to be a simple, one-click stablesend. With Eco, apps can easily accept anyone’s preferred stablecoin, regardless of the network — unlocking stablecoin liquidity from any connected chain and giving users the simplest onchain experience. To make this possible, the Eco Protocol brings together Routes, Accounts, and Crowd Liquidity (coming soon) to give app developers the ultimate flexibility while prioritizing speed, cost, and security.&#x20;

To make transaction costs negligible, minimize the number of necessary user actions, and avoid introducing centralized dependencies, Eco focuses on a singular, opinionated use case: fast, cheap, single-click stablecoin transaction execution anywhere across Ethereum (and eventually beyond). Eco is designed on the premise that stablecoins are the most intuitive and interoperable asset to bring users onchain. Eco makes it as fast and easy as possible for onchain app developers to attract stablecoin liquidity, price onchain actions in everyday currencies, and enable one-click sends to any supported chain or application.

**Eco Routes** provide developers with secure and cheap token transfer pathways between any other rollup settling on Ethereum (L2 or L3), with a network of fillers providing on-demand liquidity. **Eco Accounts** provides developers with a seamless way to manage cross-chain accounts with chain-abstracted balances, making it easy to support cross-chain interactions. The **Eco Network** will eventually aggregate liquidity to make it easy for app developers to provide users with more intuitive and cost-minimized onchain experiences denominated in stablecoins.

Eco is purpose built to maximize these benefits:

* **Simplify User Deposits of Stablecoins to One Action:** Apps will instantly expand their stablecoin offering for users while maintaining their preferred accepted stablecoin. Apps with Eco integrated can allow seamless, low-cost deposits from any OP Stack blockchain today and most major chains in the future.

* **Aggregate User Balances with an Intuitive System of User Accounts**: Eco Accounts enable complex cross-chain actions by establishing a network of smart contract wallets across all supported chains. This system facilitates seamless composition of actions between chains, streamlining user interactions.

* **Scalable to More Complex Onchain Actions:** The system fully supports advanced cross-chain operations, such as depositing into specific contracts or minting NFTs on destination chains, ensuring scalability for sophisticated use cases.

* **Highly Capital Efficient:** Solvers settle directly and exclusively in stablecoins within minutes, eliminating capital losses from price volatility and slippage. This design provides end-users with the lowest possible fees.

* **One Simple (Low) Transaction Fee:** With a single user signature, apps can easily accept multiple stablecoins across L2s and L3s. Eco is not a router or aggregator but a highly efficient solution for stablecoin settlements.

* **Secure, Cross-Chain Stablecoin Settlement:** Eco’s intent-centric architecture ensures transfers are executed before settlement. Users only pay if their transfer successfully executes on the destination chain, eliminating capital loss risk.

* **Permissionless Integration:** Developers only need to deploy Eco’s contracts and coordinate with solvers to bootstrap liquidity—or provide their own. There is no need to work with specialized operators or governance protocols.

Unlike most general-purpose protocols, Eco is highly opinionated and designed with a singular purpose in mind: *To unify liquidity* — making any onchain interaction a simple stablesend — in a way that *scales Ethereum and boosts the total addressable market (TAM) for apps* by enabling developers and users to easily interact with apps across Ethereum.
