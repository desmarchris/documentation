title: "Delegate Calls / Helper Contracts"
---

In the Beta version of the protocol, the `Inbox` contract calls the functions natively using `.Call` This means that calls like `transfer(address,uint256)`transfer funds natively from the contract, requiring solvers to pre-fill the contract with a multi-call before calling fulfill. This is actually preferred as a default behavior, because calling arbitrary contracts with `.delegateCall` would create a high risk of fulling draining a solver if the arbitrary call contained malicious code. With `.Call` as the default, the solver must pre-fund the contract, and at most, only risks the funds that were prefilled.

This, however, is not with its drawbacks, specifically with respect to gas efficiency. Therefore, future versions of the protocol will also support `.Call` to give the solvers the ability to efficiently fill orders when the set of calls are on contracts they trust. The `Inbox` contract may also be extended to allow for helper contracts to fill on behalf of solvers.
