title: "Solver Service"
---

As part of the Beta launch, there is a whitelist on the `Inbox` contract to designate which solvers are allowed to solve in the system. At outset of the Beta phase, Eco will be the only designated solver providing solving services to users. We will open up the solver pool quickly after Beta launch. An example solver repository can be found [here](https://github.com/the-eco-foundation/eco-solver).

<Note>
  If you're interested in providing solver services for the Eco protocol, please visit the Integration Inquiry link in the references section of this documentation.

### **Bend Integration**

Eco Inc. will be integrating the protocol into its free payments app Bend. The integration will allow Eco to test the protocol and its integration in a live application running on Optimism and Base, and will enable cross-chain transfers and other features in Bend to be run on trust-minimized infrastructure.
