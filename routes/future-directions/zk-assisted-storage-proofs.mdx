title: "ZK-Assisted Storage Proofs"
---

In addition to the use of batch proofs into the prover contract, an incredibly effective tool to drive down the cost of trust-minimized storage proofs offchain are ZK assisted storage proofs. ZK-assisted storage proofs allow for an arbitrarily large number of storage slots to be proven with a single ZK proof. This means that thousands of proofs could be verified with only minimal amounts of call data.

For example, projects like Axiom and RISC-Zero allow for multiple storage slots to be proven with a single supplied world state root. In a world where this kind of system was integrated into the protocol, a single protocol participant could prove all intent fulfillments for a given root on a regular cadence.
