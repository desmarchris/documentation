title: "Optimistic Claims"
---

Optimistic Claims would allow solvers to claim ownership of funds without a storage proof by providing a bond. The solver would optimistically designate a specific intent as fulfilled and then wait for a challenge period. If someone were to challenge, the challenger would post a storage proof showing a failure to fill, slashing the solver's stake and giving it to the challenger.
