## Routes: Connecting the Islands of Liquidity

Imagine a world where sending money across borders and blockchains is as easy as sending an email. That's the vision behind Eco Routes. In the blockchain world, different blockchain networks are like separate islands, each with its own currency and/or infrastructure. Eco Routes builds normalized, rapid communication links between these islands, allowing stablecoins to route seamlessly from one to another.

### What are Eco Routes?

Eco Routes are like specialized highways for stablecoins, enabling secure and efficient transfers between many different blockchain networks. Routes act as both the backbone of the Eco Protocol and the sinew of the larger Ethereum ecosystem, connecting many disparate networks together.

### Why are Eco Routes Important?

Currently, moving stablecoins between different blockchains can be a complex, slow, and costly process, often involving multiple steps and high fees. Eco Routes simplifies this process, making it as easy as a single click. This opens up a world of possibilities for users and developers, enabling:

- **Faster Transactions:** Eco Routes optimize the transfer process, reducing the time it takes to move stablecoins between chains. [ABSOLUTE TIME EXAMPLE? 1, 10, 30 SECONDS?]
- **Lower Costs:** By transacting natively on the destination network, Eco Routes minimize transaction fees, making these cross-chain stablecoin payments more affordable.
- **Increased Accessibility:** Eco Routes connect a wide range of blockchain networks, making it easier for users to access and utilize stablecoins across different platforms.

### How Eco Routes Work: Simplified

Think of Eco Routes as a network of bridges connecting different islands. When you want to send stablecoins from one island to another, you simply choose the appropriate bridge (route) and initiate the transfer. Behind the scenes, specialized entities called "solvers" ensure your stablecoins reach their destination quickly and securely.

Eco offers two types of routes, each with its own unique advantages:

- **Native Route:** This route is like a direct bridge between two islands, offering a trust-minimized way to transfer stablecoins. It leverages existing infrastructure within the Ethereum ecosystem to verify transactions, ensuring a high level of security.
- **Hyperlane Route:** This route is like a high-speed ferry, offering faster and more cost-effective transfers. It utilizes a messaging-based system to validate transactions, optimizing for speed and efficiency.
