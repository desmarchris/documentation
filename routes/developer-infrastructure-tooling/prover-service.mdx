title: "Prover Service"
---

This section heavily relies on background information found in the Routes Architecture of these docs. Please read this section of the docs before proceeding.

As part of the Beta release of the Eco Protocol, Eco Inc. will run a prover service that will prove the fulfillment of intents for the Native Route and Hyperlane Route on supported chains.

Eco Inc. will do this periodically as a service for the entire system. This will allow solvers to share the cost of proving settlement and destination routes over many intent fills, which will dramatically reduce the costs associated with providing intent fulfillment. The GitHub Repo for prover service will be open-sourced and linked here in the coming months.

### The Future of the Proving Service

There are a number of planned improvements and optimizations to the protocol that will considerably reduce the cost of running the prover service. If you are interested in learning about these, please explore the following sections in the future considerations section of this documentation:

* [Batch Proofs for Native Route](/routes/future-directions/batch-proofs-for-native-route)

* [ZK-Assisted Storage Proofs](/routes/future-directions/zk-assisted-storage-proofs)

When implemented, the cost of running the prover service will be trivial enough for a designated party or set of designated parties to provide prover services indefinitely.
