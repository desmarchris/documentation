title: "Permissionless Deployment"
---

The ultimate goal of Eco Routes is to enable permissionless deployment of Routes to any blockchain. This system has been designed with extreme extensibility, supporting various types of provers and modifications to both the intentsource and inbox contracts, enabling chains to tailor Routes to their liking. As part of the beta launch, Eco is introducing **Permissonless Liquidity**.

## Permissionless Liquidity

Permissionless Liquidity empowers blockchains to secure native liquidity from day one by leveraging the blockchains supported within Routes. Instead of relying on insecure bridges, rollups aiming to grow their native TVL can deploy Routes in just minutes. This allows them to offer users seamless deposits and interactions on their rollup while utilizing funds natively held on their blockchain.

In addition, the system enables the composition of customized actions tailored to the priorities of specific rollups. For instance, a rollup could allow users to bridge USDC and subsequently mint a Genesis NFT, with a single click approval from a chain a user already holds funds on.

When integrated with Ecoâ€™s upcoming Accounts, this solution unlocks a fully chain-abstracted experience for any rollup that adopts it, all powered by Permissionless Liquidity.
