The Eco Protocol involves three discrete systems working in concert:

* **Routes** enables apps and blockchains to access permissionless, cross-chain stablecoin liquidity — using an intent-based framework to simplify complex onchain actions into one, simple transfer. Routes are flexible and configurable, allowing developers to prioritize speed, cost, and security according to their preferences. Currently, Native and Hyperlane Routes are live, enabling fast or trustless stablecoin transfers from any rollup settling on Ethereum (L2 or L3).

* **Accounts (coming soon)** provides a standard, simple transaction experience for apps and blockchains across the Eco Protocol, allowing onchain apps to manage cross-chain accounts and support cross-chain interactions seamlessly.

* **The Eco Network (coming soon)** is designed to allocate and activate liquidity across Eco Routes and Eco Accounts, ensuring the network can enable hyper-cheap and lightning-quick stablecoin transactions wherever there is demand. Crowd Liquidity is the real game. More coming soon…

These three systems work in concert to ensure the Eco Protocol will be the default home for apps building the onchain payments stack or leveraging stablecoins for their use case.
