# Introduction to Eco Protocol  

The Eco Protocol is an open blockchain protocol designed to revolutionize stablecoin transactions across different blockchain networks. With Eco, any onchain action can be executed with a simple, one-click stablecoin send, regardless of the user's preferred stablecoin or the network it resides on. This unlocks stablecoin liquidity from any connected chain and provides users with the simplest onchain experience possible.

## The Need for Eco  

The blockchain landscape is rapidly evolving, with a growing number of users and applications relying on stablecoins for daily operations. However, cross-chain stablecoin transactions are currently fragmented and inefficient, leading to:  

- High costs  
- Slow speeds  
- Security risks  

This creates a significant barrier to entry for new users and hinders the growth of decentralized finance.  

### How Eco Solves This Problem  

Eco provides a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for cross-chain stablecoin settlement. By abstracting away blockchain complexity, Eco enables seamless stablecoin transfers between networks with just one click.  

This could significantly expand the total addressable market for onchain applications by allowing developers and users to interact across Ethereum and beyond.
